## What's new in the next js version
- Routing is now handled by the next server through the pages directory. [link to docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages)
  - Breadcrumbs have been refactored to deal with this
  - The next router also handles localization. To switch client locale `next/link` components can be used with a `locale={"ex"}` prop. [link to docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/i18n-routing)
  - `next/link` is now used to link to internal pages. This component requires a `<a>` child with no props to pass on its href to. [link to docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/link)
- Most datafetching is now handled server side through getStaticProps. [link to docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/overview)
- Images are loaded using `next/image`, with the exception of `.svg` files. [link to docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image#required-props)
- Configuration is handled by `./next.config.js`
- Nginx has been replaced by the next server
- When working locally, create a `.env.local` file at root with the following variables:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_NODE_ENV = "development"
